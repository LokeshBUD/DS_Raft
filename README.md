Distributed systems consist of multiple independent nodes that must work together while maintaining data consistency across all nodes. A key challenge in distributed environments is ensuring that all nodes agree on the same state, even in the presence of network partitions, node failures, or communication delays. Consensus algorithms provide a structured solution to this challenge by enabling nodes to reach agreement on a shared state.The Raft consensus algorithm, introduced by Diego Ongaro and JohnOusterhout in 2014, is designed to be simple, efficient, and fault-tolerant,making it a popular choice for distributed databases and key-value stores.Unlike its predecessor Paxos, Raft emphasizes understandability without sacrificing performance. This report explores the role of Raft in distributed systems, itsoperational mechanics, and why it is essential for ensuring reliability and scalability in modern distributed architectures.
